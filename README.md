# React-Portfolio
For coding bootcamp homework assignment #20, we had to create a basic react app of a personal portfolio. 

# Features
This app demonstrates my ability to create a webpage in which the user can navigate between the sections "About", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume" by rendering various react
components for each page, rather than various html pages requiring page relocations and reloads. The portfolio section also uses the same react component with props being passed in 
to change the title of each project header. Please note these are just placeholder images for now.

# Installation 
Please feel free to git clone from my repository, and install node dependencies using npm install in your CLI.
